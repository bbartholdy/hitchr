Random sample generator inspired by Douglas Adams’ The Hitchhiker’s
Guide to the Galaxy. It also allows random insertion of NAs in a dataset
(inspired by the [wakefield](https://github.com/trinker/wakefield)
package).

Currently in development.

To install:

``` r
devtools::install_github("bbartholdy/hitchr")
```

## :exclamation:Important Note:exclamation:

This package deals with the concept of ‘race’ in a strictly biological
sense; i.e., there is no way to biologically distinguish discrete races
within the *Homo sapiens* species (despite claims to the contrary).

This should not distract from the very real concept of social ‘race’,
and the social injustice that currently persists across the globe.

``` r
hitchr::infinite_improbability_drive(10) # generates a random sample of 10 individuals

Missing values can be inserted symmetrically (symm = T): equal number of
NAs in each column, or asymmetrically (symm = F): random distribution in
the columns. To insert missing values, specify the desired proportion of
missing values (0 to 1).

``` r
hitchr::iidr(10, na_prob = 0.2, symm = T)
```
