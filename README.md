Random sample generator based on Douglas Adams’ The Hitchhiker’s Guide
to the Galaxy. It also allows random insertion of NAs in a dataset
(inspired by the [wakefield](https://github.com/trinker/wakefield)
package).

:warning: Currently in development. No warranty for deprecated functions
as I come up with names I like better.

To install:

``` r
devtools::install_github("bbartholdy/hitchr")
```

## :exclamation:Important Note:exclamation:

This package deals with the concept of ‘race’ in a strictly biological
sense; i.e., there is no way to biologically distinguish discrete races
within the *Homo sapiens* species (despite claims to the contrary).

This should not distract from the very real concept of social ‘race’,
and the social injustice that currently persists across the globe.

Missing values can be inserted symmetrically (symm = T): equal number of
NAs in each column, or asymmetrically (symm = F): random distribution in
the columns. To insert missing values, specify the desired proportion of
missing values (0 to 1).

``` r
hitchr::iidr(10, na_prob = 0.2, symm = T)
```
