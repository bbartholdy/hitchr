:exclamation:**Important Note**:exclamation:

This package deals with the concept of ‘race’ in a strictly biological
sense; i.e., there is no way to biologically distinguish discrete races
within the *Homo sapiens* species (despite claims to the contrary).

This should not distract from the very real concept of social ‘race’,
and the social injustice that currently persists across the globe.
