Random sample generator inspired by Douglas Adams' The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.

Currently in development.

To install:

```{r eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("bbartholdy/hitchr")
```

:exclamation:**Important Note**:exclamation:

This package deals with the concept of 'race' in a strictly biological sense;
i.e., there is no way to biologically distinguish discrete races within the 
*Homo sapiens* species (despite claims to the contrary).

This should not distract from the very real concept of social 'race', and the social
injustice that currently persists across the globe.

## Examples

```{r eval=FALSE}
hitchr::infinite_improbability_drive(10) # generates a random sample of 10 individuals
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(random_sample)
```

Races currently available:

```{r race-index}
hitchr:::race_index()
```

Stats currently available:

```{r stats-index}
hitchr:::stats_index()
```

Sexual dimorphism in the height of males and females of different races:

```{r sex-dim}
hitchr_sample <- hitchr::inf_improb_dr(1000)
hitchr_sample %>%
  filter(sex == "male" | sex == "female") %>%
  group_by(race) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = sex, y = height, fill = race)) +
    geom_boxplot() +
    theme_minimal() +
    scale_fill_viridis_d() +
    facet_wrap(~ race) +
    theme(legend.position = "none")
```
