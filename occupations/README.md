# Contributing to occupation lists

Add occupations to any of the available races by directly editing the occupation
.tsv files, and submitting proposed changes as a pull request.

See the [hitchhiker's wiki](https://hitchhikers.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page) for 
occupation ideas. For example, Vogons are a very bureaucratic race, so the listed
jobs are some form of administration.

## Funny occupations

Yet to be assigned. Joke occupations from the [1881 british census](https://www.thepoke.co.uk/2016/03/17/extraordinary-jobs-1881-british-census/).
